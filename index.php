        <h3>Meet Rob</h3>
        <p>My passion is Website Development and Web Design with computer hardware and networking as welcomed distractions. I have had a love of computers since I was a teen. I began developing websites in the mid-90s and built my first computer in 1997.</p>
        <p>I enjoy challenging website development projects. I am often asked “Can you do this?” and most often my reply is “Given enough time and money, YES!” The Internet is a canvas that never ends and everyday day brings new challenges. I have been blessed with 2 sons that both enjoy computer programming. It seems to run in the family.</p>
